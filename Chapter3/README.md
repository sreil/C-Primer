1. Write a short program that asks for your height in integer inches and then converts
your height to feet and inches. Have the program use the underscore character to
indicate where to type the response. Also use a const symbolic constant to represent
the conversion factor.
2. Write a short program that asks for your height in feet and inches and your weight
in pounds. (Use three variables to store the information.) Have the program report
your body mass index (BMI).To calculate the BMI, first convert your height in feet
and inches to your height in inches (1 foot = 12 inches).Then convert your height
in inches to your height in meters by multiplying by 0.0254.Then convert your
weight in pounds into your mass in kilograms by dividing by 2.2. Finally, compute
your BMI by dividing your mass in kilograms by the square of your height in
meters. Use symbolic constants to represent the various conversion factors.
3. Write a program that asks the user to enter a latitude in degrees, minutes, and seconds
and that then displays the latitude in decimal format.There are 60 seconds of
arc to a minute and 60 minutes of arc to a degree; represent these values with symbolic
constants.You should use a separate variable for each input value.A sample
run should look like this:
Enter a latitude in degrees, minutes, and seconds:
First, enter the degrees: 37
Next, enter the minutes of arc: 51
Finally, enter the seconds of arc: 19
37 degrees, 51 minutes, 19 seconds = 37.8553 degrees
4. Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of seconds as an integer
value (use type long, or, if available, long long) and that then displays the equivalent
time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Use symbolic constants to represent
the number of hours in the day, the number of minutes in an hour, and the number
of seconds in a minute.The output should look like this:
Enter the number of seconds: 31600000
31600000 seconds = 365 days, 17 hours, 46 minutes, 40 seconds
5. Write a program that requests the user to enter the current world population and
the current population of the U.S. (or of some other nation of your choice). Store
the information in variables of type long long. Have the program display the percent
that the U.S. (or other nation’s) population is of the world’s population.The
output should look something like this:
Enter the world's population: 6898758899
Enter the population of the US: 310783781
The population of the US is 4.50492% of the world population.
You can use the Internet to get more recent figures.
6. Write a program that asks how many miles you have driven and how many gallons
of gasoline you have used and then reports the miles per gallon your car has gotten.
Or, if you prefer, the program can request distance in kilometers and petrol in liters
and then report the result European style, in liters per 100 kilometers.
7. Write a program that asks you to enter an automobile gasoline consumption figure
in the European style (liters per 100 kilometers) and converts to the U.S. style of
miles per gallon. Note that in addition to using different units of measurement, the
U.S. approach (distance / fuel) is the inverse of the European approach (fuel / distance).
Note that 100 kilometers is 62.14 miles, and 1 gallon is 3.875 liters.Thus, 19
mpg is about 12.4 l/100 km, and 27 mpg is about 8.7 l/100 km.
