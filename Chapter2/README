1. Write a C++ program that displays your name and address (or if you value your
privacy, a fictitious name and address).
2. Write a C++ program that asks for a distance in furlongs and converts it to yards.
(One furlong is 220 yards.)
3. Write a C++ program that uses three user-defined functions (counting main() as
one) and produces the following output:
Three blind mice
Three blind mice
See how they run
See how they run
One function, called two times, should produce the first two lines, and the remaining
function, also called twice, should produce the remaining output.
4. Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her age.The program then should
display the age in months:
Enter your age: 29
Your age in months is 384.
5. Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes a Celsius
temperature value as an argument and then returns the equivalent Fahrenheit value.
The program should request the Celsius value as input from the user and display
the result, as shown in the following code:
Please enter a Celsius value: 20
20 degrees Celsius is 68 degrees Fahrenheit.
For reference, here is the formula for making the conversion:
Fahrenheit = 1.8 Ã— degrees Celsius + 32.0
6. Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes a distance
in light years as an argument and then returns the distance in astronomical units.
The program should request the light year value as input from the user and display
the result, as shown in the following code:
Enter the number of light years: 4.2
4.2 light years = 265608 astronomical units.
An astronomical unit is the average distance from the earth to the sun (about
150,000,000 km or 93,000,000 miles), and a light year is the distance light travels in
a year (about 10 trillion kilometers or 6 trillion miles). (The nearest star after the
sun is about 4.2 light years away.) Use type double (as in Listing 2.4) and this conversion
factor:
1 light year = 63,240 astronomical units
7. Write a program that asks the user to enter an hour value and a minute value.The
main() function should then pass these two values to a type void function that displays
the two values in the format shown in the following sample run:
Enter the number of hours: 9
Enter the number of minutes: 28
Time: 9:28
