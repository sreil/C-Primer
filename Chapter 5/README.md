1. Write a program that requests the user to enter two integers.The program should
then calculate and report the sum of all the integers between and including the two
integers. At this point, assume that the smaller integer is entered first. For example, if
the user enters 2 and 9, the program should report that the sum of all the integers
from 2 through 9 is 44.
2. Redo Listing 5.4 using a type array object instead of a built-in array and type
long double instead of long long. Find the value of 100!
3. Write a program that asks the user to type in numbers.After each entry, the program
should report the cumulative sum of the entries to date.The program should
terminate when the user enters 0.
4. Daphne invests $100 at 10% simple interest.That is, every year, the investment earns
10% of the original investment, or $10 each and every year:
interest = 0.10 × original balance
At the same time, Cleo invests $100 at 5% compound interest.That is, interest is 5%
of the current balance, including previous additions of interest:
interest = 0.05 × current balance
Cleo earns 5% of $100 the first year, giving her $105.The next year she earns 5% of
$105, or $5.25, and so on.Write a program that finds how many years it takes for
the value of Cleo’s investment to exceed the value of Daphne’s investment and then
displays the value of both investments at that time.
5. You sell the book C++ for Fools.Write a program that has you enter a year’s worth
of monthly sales (in terms of number of books, not of money).The program should
use a loop to prompt you by month, using an array of char * (or an array of
string objects, if you prefer) initialized to the month strings and storing the input
data in an array of int.Then, the program should find the sum of the array contents
and report the total sales for the year.
6. Do Programming Exercise 5 but use a two-dimensional array to store input for 3
years of monthly sales. Report the total sales for each individual year and for the
combined years.
7. Design a structure called car that holds the following information about an automobile:
its make, as a string in a character array or in a string object, and the year
it was built, as an integer.Write a program that asks the user how many cars to catalog.
The program should then use new to create a dynamic array of that many car
structures. Next, it should prompt the user to input the make (which might consist
of more than one word) and year information for each structure. Note that this
requires some care because it alternates reading strings with numeric data (see
Chapter 4). Finally, it should display the contents of each structure.A sample run
should look something like the following:
How many cars do you wish to catalog? 2
Car #1:
Please enter the make: Hudson Hornet
Please enter the year made: 1952
Car #2:
Please enter the make: Kaiser
Please enter the year made: 1951
Here is your collection:
1952 Hudson Hornet
1951 Kaiser
8. Write a program that uses an array of char and a loop to read one word at a time
until the word done is entered.The program should then report the number of
words entered (not counting done).A sample run could look like this:
Enter words (to stop, type the word done):
anteater birthday category dumpster
envy finagle geometry done for sure
You entered a total of 7 words.
You should include the cstring header file and use the strcmp() function to
make the comparison test.
9. Write a program that matches the description of the program in Programming
Exercise 8, but use a string class object instead of an array. Include the string
header file and use a relational operator to make the comparison test.
10. Write a program using nested loops that asks the user to enter a value for the
number of rows to display. It should then display that many rows of asterisks, with
one asterisk in the first row, two in the second row, and so on. For each row, the
asterisks are preceded by the number of periods needed to make all the rows
display a total number of characters equal to the number of rows.A sample run
would look like this:
Enter number of rows: 5
....*
...**
..***
.****
