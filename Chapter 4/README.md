1. Write a C++ program that requests and displays information as shown in the following
example of output:
What is your first name? Betty Sue
What is your last name? Yewe
What letter grade do you deserve? B
What is your age? 22
Name: Yewe, Betty Sue
Grade: C
Age: 22
Note that the program should be able to accept first names that comprise more
than one word. Also note that the program adjusts the grade downward—that is, up
one letter.Assume that the user requests an A, a B, or a C so that you don’t have to
worry about the gap between a D and an F.
2. Rewrite Listing 4.4, using the C++ string class instead of char arrays.
3. Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her first name and then last
name, and that then constructs, stores, and displays a third string, consisting of the
user’s last name followed by a comma, a space, and first name. Use char arrays and
functions from the cstring header file.A sample run could look like this:
Enter your first name: Flip
Enter your last name: Fleming
Here’s the information in a single string: Fleming, Flip
4. Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her first name and then last
name, and that then constructs, stores, and displays a third string consisting of the
user’s last name followed by a comma, a space, and first name. Use string objects
and methods from the string header file.A sample run could look like this:
Enter your first name: Flip
Enter your last name: Fleming
Here’s the information in a single string: Fleming, Flip
5. The CandyBar structure contains three members.The first member holds the brand
name of a candy bar.The second member holds the weight (which may have a fractional
part) of the candy bar, and the third member holds the number of calories
(an integer value) in the candy bar.Write a program that declares such a structure
and creates a CandyBar variable called snack, initializing its members to "Mocha
Munch", 2.3, and 350, respectively.The initialization should be part of the declaration
for snack. Finally, the program should display the contents of the snack variable.
6. The CandyBar structure contains three members, as described in Programming
Exercise 5.Write a program that creates an array of three CandyBar structures, initializes
them to values of your choice, and then displays the contents of each structure.
7. William Wingate runs a pizza-analysis service. For each pizza, he needs to record
the following information:
n The name of the pizza company, which can consist of more than one word
n The diameter of the pizza
n The weight of the pizza
Devise a structure that can hold this information and write a program that uses a
structure variable of that type.The program should ask the user to enter each of the
preceding items of information, and then the program should display that information.
Use cin (or its methods) and cout.
8. Do Programming Exercise 7 but use new to allocate a structure instead of declaring
a structure variable.Also have the program request the pizza diameter before it
requests the pizza company name.
9. Do Programming Exercise 6, but instead of declaring an array of three CandyBar
structures, use new to allocate the array dynamically.
10. Write a program that requests the user to enter three times for the 40-yd dash (or
40-meter, if you prefer) and then displays the times and the average. Use an array
object to hold the data. (Use a built-in array if array is not available.)
